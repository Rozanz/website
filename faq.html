		<h5>What is Our Adoption Process Like With Covid-19?</h5>
			<ol>
				<li> View our Petfinder page to see our available animals. </li>
				<li> If you see a pet you would like to meet, please request meet-and-greet.  Please note that all animal meetings are by appointment only. </li>
				<li> After you have contacted us we will arrange a time to meet the animal at our facility. </li>
				<li> We will ask you some questions to see if we feel like the home you are offering is right for that animal. </li>
				<li> If it sounds like a good home, we will offer you an adoption application. </li>
				<li> You will need to bring a valid state-issued photo ID for us to check your identity.  If you lease or rent your property, please provide proof that pets are permitted.  </li>
				<li> If your application is approved, you must pay the adoption fee upfront and you may take your new family member home the same day.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
		<h5>Would You like to Request a Meeting?</h5>
		<ol>
			<li> All animal introductions are by appointment only. </li>
			<li>Not all booking requests can be approved.</li>
			<li>Please specify the animal or species you wish to meet.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		
		<h5>How do I Volunteer?</h5>
		<p>If you wish to volunteer please visit the shelter during business hours and ask one of the full time volunteers for an application. 
		You may either take the application with you or fill it out at that time. You will need to meet with one of our full timers to do a small questionnaire, 
		to make sure you would be a good fit for our facility. If you are approved we ask that you sign up for days that you would like to come in on the provided 
		calendar. We ask that you sign up so that we can make sure we have things for you to do. If you are unsure of your availability you may call the day of
		and see what we need help with or you could stop in and see how things are going. There are many jobs that volunteers can do. Some of these jobs include: 
		cleaning cages, sweeping/ mopping the floors, dusting merchandise, socializing animals, and much more! We appreciate every ounce of help that we get!
		Volunteers must be age 16+ or have an adult stay with them on the premises for the full duration of volunteer shift.</p><br>

		<h5>Can I take a tour?</h5>
		<p>We are DELIGHTED to announce that our public weekend tours season will commence May 1st, 2021. For safety reasons, tickets must be purchased online in
		advance and we are keeping tour numbers small. We are also still offering Member Tours and Sponsor Visits (by appointment). Social-distancing and mask-wearing 
		are a requirement. Our mask rule includes all children, so unfortunately we can’t welcome any child who is too young to safely wear a mask. Thank you for understanding!
		We also have live-streaming programs and video calls that you’ll love! Check out our Events page and social media for more. 
		</p><br>
		
		<h5>Can I take photographs?</h5>
		<p>Yes, but Sanctuary rules require guests turn off their flash, and never taunt, yell, or scream at the animal residents for photographs.</p><br>

		<h5>Do I need a reservation?</h5>
		<p>Reservations are not necessary for general visitation on Wednesdays, which is available only to  Park Pal members, due to COVID 19 procedures. 
		We recommend calling ahead to make reservations for guided and private tours as tour size is limited. Reservations can be made at here.</p><br>
		
		<h5>Are pets allowed in the Sanctuary?</h5>
		<p>No.  This is for the safety of your pet, and the animal residents, as they may become aggressive or agitated by visiting domestic pets. 
		Service animals are the exception, with proper proof of necessity.</p><br>
		
		<h5>Is food available at the Sanctuary?</h5>
		<p>Visitors are welcome to bring a picnic and enjoy the covered pavilion with picnic tables on a first come first served basis.  
		Sanctuary rules prohibit alcohol and smoking. Grills, or other cooking devices are not allowed due to safety precautions.</p><br>
		
		<h5>Is the Sanctuary open when it’s raining?</h5>
		<p>Yes.  We are open during regular season during the rain, and close only if there is lightning, high winds and/or steady heavy rain,
		or the weather is dangerous.  Prepaid reservations are subject to our cancellation policy.</p><br>
