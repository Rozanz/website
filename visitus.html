		<h3 class="text-white text-center">VISITING THE SANCTUARY</h3>
		<p>The Sanctuary has no regular, open hours for the public but we offer <strong>private
		educational tours</strong> where you will learn about and meet our exotic animal residents.</p>
		
		<p>PLEASE, FOR THE SAFETY AND COMFORT OF THE ANIMALS
		WE DO NOT <strong>EVER</strong> ALLOW UNSCHEDULED, "DROP-IN" VISITORS</p>
		
		<p>To schedule a tour please e-mail us at <a href = "mailto: tour@threeringranch.org."> tour@threeringranch.org.</a></p>
		<p><strong>This information will help you plan your visit to the Three Ring Ranch</strong></p>
		
		<p>We offer exciting educational tours for small groups which last about two hours.
		It is an incredible close-up experience for children and adults<br> to learn about the
		behavior and communication of our exotic animal residents and learn how they came to be here.
		</p>
		
		<p>The sanctuary is unique as we have exotic and endangered native wildlife living their 
		lives with us as educational ambassadors.<br> Visitors see our animals up close including the
		Hawaiian nene, i'o & pueo.
		</p>
		
		<p>Our regular tour time is 11am right after we complete the morning feeding rounds and the a
		nimals are alert and ready for some visitor fun. Tours end about 1pm.<br> We only do one tour per
		day, so please contact us as soon as you know what day you would like to schedule your tour.
		</p>
		
		<p>We cannot accommodate drop-ins. All visits must be arranged in advance. This is very important
		because most of our day is spent taking the absolute best possible care of the animals and we must
		adhere to their care schedule.</p>
		<p>We have no set fee for the educational tour but have a minimum donation of $50 per person
		(adult or child). 100% of all donations go to help us provide lifetime feed and care for our
		many resident animals. We are a 501©3 non-profit, all volunteer organization and we can provide
		a donation receipt for your taxes. Our animals say, Mahalo!</p>
		
		<p>If you have a group of 6 or more we can schedule a tour just for your group. Otherwise, we combine 
		groups together until we have a minimum of 6 guests for each tour.</p>
		
		
		<p>If you would like to have a more personalized experience we can accommodate your visit with a <strong>VIP
		Tour for a minimum donation of $350 (6 people or fewer)</strong>. A VIP Tour will go at your pace and you can
		spend more one-on-one time with your favorite animals. If we don't have a group tour available or we
		have not reached our 6 person minimum on your selected date, a VIP tour is the only way we can
		accommodate your visit. Family groups of over 7 may also book a VIP tour for the standard $50 
		per person minimum donation.</p>
		
		<h6>You may <h5> PRE-PAY FOR YOUR TOUR <a href= "https://store.threeringranch.org/products/ranch-visit-donations " target="_blank">HERE</a></h5></h6>
		
		<p>Guests must be at least 6 years old. Through experience, we have learned that children under 6 have a
		natural exuberance which is extremely difficult for them to contain. Unfortunately, this exuberance is not
		understood by the animals which can create an unsafe situation for the animals or children. We must always
		remember that this is the animals' home and we are the guests.</p>
		
		<p>You will need sturdy and/or closed toe shoes (e.g., tennis shoes or walking sandals) as we will be walking
		on some uneven surfaces. Total distance walked over 2 hours is ~1,000 ft. with minimal elevation changes and 
		frequent stops. We can bring a light chair on the tour if you would like to rest periodically. And, most 
		importantly, make sure you bring your camera as you will want to take many photos along the way.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately we are not wheelchair accessible in our pasture areas. Please,<strong> LEAVE YOUR PET AT HOME.</strong></p>
		
		<p>To schedule a tour, please make sure you have left us your full contact information and we will get back to you as soon as possible as we are frequently outside caring fro the animals. If you prefer to call, we can usually be reached in the evening after 6 pm Hawaii time at 808-331-8778.
</p>
		<p>You can also purchase <strong>TOUR GIFT CERTIFICATES</strong>from our <a href="https://store.threeringranch.org/products/tour-certificatesonline">store.</a> These gift certificates are a great way to send your friends or favorite small group to see the animals up close and personal.</p>
		
		<p>Mahalo, and we look forward to welcoming you to the Three Ring Ranch.</p>
